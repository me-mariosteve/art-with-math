# cpp-opencv-things

## Description

This is my first project with OpenCV, and my first project in C++ and my biggest too.

Its purpose is to generate, animate and create an image or a video only using points generated by calculus and algorithms.

## Build

To build the project, you must have cmake, make, opencv installed.

Then run the following command in the root folder:

```
./make
```

It creates the cmake configuration files in `build/` then build the project.

The produced executables are put in `build/`. `build/project` results from `main.cpp` and `build/imgtools` from `imgtools/imgtools.cpp`.
